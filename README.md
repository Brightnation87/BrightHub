# BrightHub

BrightHub is an all-in-one learning and coding platform prototype designed to help learners study, practice, and experiment in one unified environment. It brings together learning content, a code-focused workspace, and the foundation for AI-assisted guidance in a mobile-friendly interface.

This project was built and submitted for the **Missing Amps Winter Classic Hackathon**.

## 🚀 Inspiration

Learning technical skills often requires switching between multiple tools — tutorials, editors, terminals, documentation, and AI helpers. This fragmentation is especially frustrating on mobile devices, where context switching breaks focus and slows progress.

BrightHub was inspired by the need for a **single, focused workspace** where learners can read, practice, and experiment without leaving the platform. The goal is to support learners who rely heavily on mobile devices or have limited access to full desktop setups, while still offering a structured and practical learning experience.

## 🧠 What BrightHub Does

BrightHub provides a unified dashboard that brings together learning resources and development tools into one application. Instead of jumping between apps or tabs, users can explore learning content and interact with a coding-focused environment within the same interface.

The current version demonstrates the core concept and architecture as a hackathon prototype.
